# WHVI: Walsh-Hadamard Variational Inference for Bayesian Deep Learning

Code for the paper [Walsh-Hadamard Variational Inference for Bayesian Deep Learning](https://proceedings.neurips.cc//paper/2020/hash/6df182582740607da754e4515b70e32d-Abstract.html).

The repository is organized as follows:
* `src` contains the source code for WHVI layers, neural network examples which use the layers, utility functions for fast matrix operations and for the fast Walsh-Hadamard transform (FWHT);
* `test` contains unit tests for manually implemented functions;
* `speed_benchmarks` contains speed tests for manually implemented functions;
* `experiments` contains reproductions of the experiments from the original paper.
